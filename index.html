            <p><h4>Culture Shock</h4></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
             <b><i>Culture shock</i></b> is the first thing you experience when you are away from your comfort zone. Sometimes it could be terrifying, disgusting, or exciting; either way, you learn something new. Different folks have different strokes, they say, but the stroke might turn into a cane stroke, especially when you are unprepared for it or are clueless about how to react. I remember growing up in the southern part of Nigeria and thinking my tribe was a minority, only to be taught in social studies that it was one of the major tribes. Basically, they meant our language was largely spoken, not that we were graced with more privilege or were feared by the minority due to our large number, or that I was in dire need of anyone addressing me in awe of my tribe. Nevertheless, I have remained perplexed as to why we are referred to as the majority tribe with so much emphasis, as though we have something to gain. So I dare say my culture shock is the heinous threat I face when I mention my tribe because I am bound to face unprecedented harsh treatment or be viewed as a threat. Among my brothers, I dare not say I cannot speak my language fluently without sounding like a joke because it will result in unwarranted disrespect or being viewed as a stranger. I guess my fight to survive as a human is pointless if I am viewed as a threat by other tribes or as a stranger by my brothers.
